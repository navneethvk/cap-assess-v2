- **Responsive**: Touch and gesture feedback
- **Performant**: Hardware-accelerated transforms
- **Accessible**: Respects reduced motion preferences

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Firebase CLI
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd cap-assess-pwa
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
# Root level (Firebase)
npm install

# Frontend
cd panels-pwa
npm install

# Functions
cd ../functions
npm install
```

3. **Environment Setup**
Create `panels-pwa/.env` with Firebase configuration:
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

4. **Development**
```bash
# Start PWA development server
cd panels-pwa
npm run dev

# Start Firebase emulators (separate terminal)
cd ..
firebase emulators:start
```

### Cloud Function Configuration
The export functions expect Cloud Storage settings via runtime config. Run once per project (replace the bucket/prefix as needed; prefix defaults to `backups/visits`):

```bash
firebase functions:config:set \
  exports.bucket="your-export-bucket" \
  exports.prefix="backups/visits"

# Deploy functions after updating config
npm --prefix functions run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### PWA Details
- Manifest (`public/manifest.webmanifest`) declares icons, scope, shortcuts, and theme color for install banners.
- A custom service worker (`public/service-worker.js`) caches navigation requests and serves `offline.html` when the network is unavailable.
- `src/main.tsx` registers the service worker after the app loads; no extra work is needed for users to install the app.

To test installation locally:
1. Build and preview the app (`npm --prefix panels-pwa run build && npm --prefix panels-pwa run preview`).
2. Open the preview URL in Chrome or Safari on a device; use ‚ÄúAdd to Home Screen‚Äù / ‚ÄúInstall app‚Äù.
3. Toggle airplane mode and revisit the app to see the offline fallback page.

## üìú Scripts

### PWA Development (panels-pwa/)
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Production build with TypeScript check
npm run lint         # ESLint code analysis
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Firebase Functions (functions/)
```bash
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
npm run serve        # Local emulator
npm run deploy       # Deploy to Firebase
npm run logs         # View function logs
npm run lint         # ESLint for functions
```

### Firebase Deployment
```bash
firebase deploy                    # Deploy everything
firebase deploy --only functions  # Functions only
firebase deploy --only hosting    # Hosting only
firebase emulators:start          # Start all emulators
```

To deploy the PWA to Hosting after running a production build:
```bash
npm --prefix panels-pwa run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

If you only need to refresh the Cloud Storage backup code:
```bash
npm --prefix functions run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## üîê Security & Roles

### User Roles
- **Pending**: New users awaiting admin approval
- **User**: Standard access to assessment features
- **Admin**: Full system access including user management

### Security Rules
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid Firebase auth
- **Role-Based Access**: Firestore rules enforce permission levels
- **Custom Claims**: Firebase Auth tokens carry role information
- **Audit Trail**: Soft delete patterns preserve data history

## üéØ Recent Updates

### v3.0 - Modern Healthcare Design System
- ‚úÖ Complete theme overhaul from cyberpunk to healthcare aesthetic
- ‚úÖ Implemented modern push button design with solid offset shadows
- ‚úÖ Created pill-shaped buttons (9999px border-radius) for tactile feel
- ‚úÖ Added healthcare-inspired color palette (soft pink, warm cream)
- ‚úÖ Updated typography to modern sans-serif with enhanced letter-spacing
- ‚úÖ Fixed tab button styling to maintain shadows across all states
- ‚úÖ Removed background containers from tabs for cleaner appearance
- ‚úÖ Enhanced navigation buttons with consistent push button styling

### Design System Updates
- **Modern Push Buttons**: 3D effect with solid offset shadows (4px 4px)
- **Hover States**: Diagonal lift (-5px, -5px) with extended shadow (9px 9px)  
- **Active States**: Button moves to shadow position (4px, 4px) with no shadow
- **Pill Shape**: Full oval borders for better tactile illusion
- **Healthcare Colors**: Warm, approachable palette suitable for care institutions
- **Clean Typography**: Professional, readable fonts with consistent spacing

### v3.1 - Admin Panel, Date UI, and Timeline Reordering

- Admin Panel
  - Simplified tab switcher to standard buttons (removed segmented tabs)
  - Added robust token refresh after role updates to sync custom claims
  - Improved error messages and logging for CCI and Assign panels

- Date Carousel
  - Infinite scrolling days with dynamic loading as you scroll
  - Centered selected date and applied primary blue highlight
  - Combined month/year into a single iOS-style dropdown selector
  - Fixed dropdown transparency with opaque content styles
  - Removed left/right buttons, centered controls, oval styling for picker and Today

- Visits Timeline
  - ‚ÄúAdd Visit‚Äù redesigned to + buttons positioned above and below the list
  - Introduced custom `order` field for deterministic ordering
  - Real-time drag-and-drop reordering with compact card mode while moving
  - Move mode persists until Done is clicked; all cards compress for clarity
  - Frontend updates list locally during drag for smooth animation
  - Persist orders to Firestore only when Done is clicked
  - Offline support: queued order updates via persisted Zustand store
  - Automatic sync of queued updates when app comes back online

- Auth & Stores
  - `authStore` gained `refreshToken`, `clearStore`, and versioning
  - New `reorderStore` (Zustand + persist) stores move mode and pending updates

- Firestore & Hosting
  - Rules relaxed for Admin reads on `ccis` and `cci_user_links`
  - Hosting `public` changed to `panels-pwa/dist`

### Reordering: How It Works

- Start dragging any visit to enter move mode (cards compress)
- Items reorder instantly on the client as you move between positions
- Click Done to save; we normalize orders as 1000, 2000, 3000, ...
- Offline: we queue updates locally and auto-sync when online

### Developer Notes

- Env: ensure `panels-pwa/.env` is present with Firebase values (no quotes)
- If CCI/Assign tabs fail: confirm Auth custom claims; `AdminSettings` forces token refresh after updates
- If reordering feels off: see `VisitsTimeline.tsx` and `panels-pwa/src/store/reorderStore.ts`
